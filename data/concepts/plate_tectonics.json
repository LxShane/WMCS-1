    "definition": "A scientific theory describing the large-scale motion of seven large plates and the movements of a larger number of smaller plates of the Earth's lithosphere, since tectonic processes began on Earth between 3.3 and 3.5 billion years ago. The relative motion of these plates causes earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, mountain-building, and other geological phenomena."
