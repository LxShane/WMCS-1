      "Solar radiation enters Earth's atmosphere",

      "Remaining radiation is absorbed by the Earth's surface, warming it",
      "The warmed surface emits infrared radiation",
      "Greenhouse gases absorb some of the infrared radiation and re-emit it in all directions, warming the surface and lower atmosphere",

    "evidence_summary": "Observed increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations correlate with increases in global average temperatures. Climate models incorporating the greenhouse effect accurately predict historical temperature trends and future warming scenarios. Satellite measurements confirm that less infrared radiation is escaping into space at wavelengths absorbed by greenhouse gases."
