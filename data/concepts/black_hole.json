    "evidence_summary": "Black holes are indirectly observed through their gravitational effects on surrounding matter and light. Strong evidence comes from observations of stars orbiting seemingly empty space at very high speeds, as well as the detection of gravitational waves from black hole mergers. The Event Horizon Telescope has directly imaged the shadow of a black hole."
